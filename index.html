            <h1>My dog eats grass like a cow.</h1>
            <p>I have two dogs, one is named Maka and the other is named Penny. Maka was the first dog we adopted from
                the
                shelter. She's a goofball. She looks exactly like a cow right down to the color and body type. She is a
                sweetheart that captures the hearts of everyone. She is a loving girl but this girl does not like other
                dogs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maka comes from the anime "Soul Eater."</li>
                <li>Maka is actually a cow IRL.</li>
                <li>Maka will do anything for food.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My other dog acts more like a snake than a dog.</h2>
            <p> Penny is our second dog. She is skiddish and needs time to trust people. She had a rough past but we
                don't
                hold
                that against her. She is a weirdo though. She likes to stick her tongue out repeatedly like a snake.
                She's
                also
                a goofball but that is okay.</p>

            <!--why is purple a funny color-->
            <h3>Purple is a funny color.</h3>
            <p>Purple is funny because of the nature. Who thought to combine blue and red to make that color? Why did
                royalty
                adopt it as "their" color. My personal opinion about it is that it should not be the color of a car.
                Just
                not
                right.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is it blue or is it red?</li>
                <li>My friend had a purple truck that he called blue.</li>
                <li>I still don't see the appeal.</li>

            <h4>There is a fruit called kumquat.</h4>
            <p>Have you ever had a kumquat? It is a strange fruit indeed. It looks like a small orange but if you think
                it
                is
                sweet, you will be sourly mistaken. See what I did there? It's funny because they are more like lemons
                than
                oranges.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Small sour oranges.</li>
                <li>That's what a kumquat is.</li>
                <li>Don't let them ruin your teeth.</li>

            <h6>H6 is a funny line.</h6>
            <p>As a person who works in healthcare, learning to code is becoming ever so interesting to me. I like
                working
                in
                healthcare, particularly in the physical therapy world. The problem is the healthcare field is changing
                and
                not
                for the better. It feels like insurance companies are controlling everything and only allowing what they
                want.
                That's why I am learning to code. I have always loved computers and now I can learn even more about
                them.
